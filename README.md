- 👋 Hi, I’m @ScottCowling
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming in C#, C++, Python & Javascript for server, local apps, and microcontrollers (the latest craze for me).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# Inversion of Control/Dependency Injection patterns with ASP.NET Core.
- 💞️ I’m am not looking to collaborate on anything for the time being because I am still learning so much, but any repo I publish I am happy to take edits for to improve my existing code so I can learn from others :) 
- 📫 How to reach me: Here is the only place I appear at the moment :)
